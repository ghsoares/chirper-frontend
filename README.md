# Chirper
### A simple Twitter clone made with SpringBoot and Angular

(inspired on Twitter's name being based on the bird onomatopoeia "tweet", Chirper stands for "chirp").

On Chirper, you can post messages saying how you are feeling, what's happening or showing something cool!

A single message post goes for the name "chirp", each chirp can contain a message and embeded media like images, videos or url previews to express your thoughts!

As little birds enjoys talking in the nature, you can talk to other people replying to their chirps with a chirp too! You can also like any chirp you liked!

This is a simple portfolio project created by a single soul to show it's development abilities, I hope you enjoy it!
